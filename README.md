Built a Live Bookings Viewer to display real-time venue booking updates across multiple clients. 🎉🏟️

This project allowed me to explore real-time web applications using Socket.IO, creating an interactive dashboard that updates instantly as bookings occur.

✨ Key Highlights:

🎯 Real-Time Communication: Leveraged Socket.IO to push live booking updates to all connected clients instantly.

🧑‍💻 Full-Stack Integration: Developed a Node.js and Express.js backend with in-memory data storage, connected to a responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

📊 Dynamic UI & Visualization: Implemented a clean, card-based interface with smooth animations, responsive layouts, and a connection status indicator.

💡 Simulation & Performance: Generated realistic booking data automatically every 5 seconds while optimizing the display to handle up to 50 bookings without performance issues.

📈 Deployment & Customization: Configurable port settings, venue names, booking frequency, and fully customizable CSS for a tailored user experience.

Excited to further explore real-time applications and build interactive dashboards that enhance user engagement and operational efficiency! 🚀
